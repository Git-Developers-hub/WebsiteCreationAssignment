        <h1>Food in Ireland</h1>
        <p> These are some of my favourite Irish foods! </p>
        <h2>Traditional Irish Breakfast</h2>
        <p> A "Full Irish" breakfast consists of sausages, rashers
            (bacon), eggs, black pudding, white pudding
            and toast.
        </p>
        <p> Often there will be a grilled tomato as well as mushrooms,
            and baked beans. </p>
        <p> And of course, no breakfast is complete without a lovely pot
            of tea! </p>
        <h2>Bangers and Mash</h2>
        <p> This classic of sausages, mashed potato and gravy is not unique to Ireland, but what makes it special is the
            Irish sausages. Most countries have their own way of making sausages, and they are one thing I miss from
            home if I'm away travelling!
